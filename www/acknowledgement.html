<p>Ahmad Reza Hosseinpoor and Anne Schlotheuber (World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland) conceptualized this version of the toolkit and coordinated its development. The application was developed by ZevRoss Spatial Analysis.</p>
<p>Devaki Nambiar (Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, India) and Anne Schlotheuber prepared the user manual and technical notes. Tengfei Li (Georgetown University, Washington D.C., USA), George Luta (Georgetown University, Washington D.C., USA and Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark) and Margarita Moreno-Betancur (Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Parkville, Australia) provided technical advice for the calculation of summary measures.</p>
<p>The software was tested by the participants of a capacity-building workshop on health inequality monitoring held in Indonesia in November 2016. Furthermore, a number of individuals helped test the software and provided valuable feedback, including Ties Boerma (University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada), Tengfei Li, Lotus McDougal (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, USA), Margarita Moreno-Betancur and Ghada Saad (University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon), as well as several World Health Organization staff members: Alarcos Cieza, Richard Johnston, Lindsay Lee, Francesco Mitis and Carla Sabariego (World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland), Hongyi Xu (World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa, Brazzaville, Congo) and Mark Landry and Ruchita Rajbhandary (World Health Organization Regional Office for South-East Asia, New Delhi, India).</p>
